This is coming from [this repository](https://github.com/veritasalice/CERN_Summer_Student_demo_2019)

This is a gallery of demo analyses performed on public data of [ATLAS at LHC] (www.atlas.cern) experiment.

Many analyses are ROOTbooks. For more information about the ROOT framework, visit http://root.cern.ch

Analyses created by the ATLAS Outreach Open Data&Tool group.
"Binderised" by Danilo Piparo, danilo.piparo@cern.ch, and Enric Tejedor, enric.tejedor.saavedra@cern.ch and Arturo Sánchez, arturos@cern.ch.
